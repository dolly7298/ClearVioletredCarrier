      Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2017 reality show of the same name. </span><span
      class="v3_11">GROUP HISTORY:</span>
    <div class="v3_17"></div><span class="v3_13">The group's name "Stray Kids" was not defined by JYP Entertainment
      but conceptualized by the members themselves.
      It originally referred to a lost child who wants to chase
      their dreams and later evolved to represent
      the idea of finding a way together out of the ordinary.</span><span class="v3_15">In August 2017, JYP
      Entertainment (JYPE) officially announced
      their new reality survival show with the goal of launching a male idol debut project.
      More details and teasers were released in the next two months,
      including the show's title, Stray Kids.
       Prior to its premiere on October 17, JYP released Stray Kids' first music video
      for a song titled "Hellevator", which was later released as a digital single.
      Two members, Lee Know and Felix, were initially eliminated from the group
      but returned to the final nine-member line-up.</span><span class="v3_20">MUSIC:</span>
    <div class="v3_22"></div><span class="v3_24">The participants themselves are responsible for the music and the
      company plays almost no role in the creation of the songs.
      The main producers of the group are a trio of guys under the name “3 racha” (BangChan,Han,Changbin)</span><span
      class="v3_25">*Team leader BangChan holds the title of one of the most talented artists in Korea and ranks in the
      top 10 in terms of number of songs written.</span><span class="v3_26">CONCERTS:</span><span class="v3_29">At the
      moment this group is one of the most
      popular in the whole world.
      Every year they travel with concerts
      and amaze fans with effects,
      magnificent dancing and live vocals.</span>
    <div class="v3_30"></div><span class="v3_31">Concerts last for 2 hours since
      the elements of the show
      are very large-scale
      and even during this time
      it is not always possible
      to present the entire album </span>
